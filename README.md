Movie Rating Prediction with Python 

Movie Rating Prediction project aims to create a model that accurately predicts the rating of a movie based on various features such as genre, director, and actors. Using regression techniques, we delve into data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling to achieve this goal.

The primary objective is to analyze historical movie data and build a model that effectively estimates the ratings assigned to movies by users or critics. Through this, we seek to uncover the factors influencing movie ratings and develop a reliable model for predicting movie ratings accurately.
